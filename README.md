# Generative-Algorithm-Water-fountain-AI

This code is a demonstration of a simple [Genectic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm). Here, a source throws water from the left side of the canvas and tries to direct the water at a particular point at the right side of the canvas. By running for a several generations, the ai gets the right prediction of the angle to throw the water and the water fall gets closer to the target.

>__The red line shows the best water fall from the previous generation. In the first generation, the first random fall is assumed the best fall.__
